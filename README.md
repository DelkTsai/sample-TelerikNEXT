# sample-TelerikNEXT
Open source cross-platform TelerikNEXT conference app built with NativeScript.

Use this application to find-out how to implement common mobile scenarios with NativeScript.

This application is using the drawer component from Telerik UI for [iOS](http://www.telerik.com/ios-ui/sidedrawer) and [Android](http://www.telerik.com/android-ui/sidedrawer). You can add drawer libraries to NativeScript app using our [CLI library add command](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli#the-commands).

Work in progress! Please contact us if you have any questions and/or problems.
